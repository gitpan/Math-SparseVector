This module has been developed on Linux and Unix platforms, using Perl
programming language. To use this module, you must have Perl (version
5.8 or better recommended) installed on your system. Perl is freely 
available at - http://www.perl.org. It is very likely that you will 
already have Perl installed if you are using a Unix/Linux based system.

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The exact location of where Math::SparseVector will be installed depends
on your system configuration.

If you do not have authority to write into system directories, you can
install Math::SparseVector in a local directory that you own and have 
permissions to read and write into as follows:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/YOUR/DIR
    make
    make test
    make install

This will install the module into

    /YOUR/DIR/lib/perl5/site_perl/Math/SparseMatrix.pm

If you install Math::SparseVector in a local directory, you will have to 
explicitly set your PERL5LIB environment variable to include:

    /YOUR/DIR/lib/perl5/site_perl
