INSTALL Installation instructions for Math::SparseVetor

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module has been developed on Linux and Unix platforms, using the 
Perl programming language. To use this module, you must have Perl (version
5.6.2 or better recommended) installed on your system. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The exact location of where Math::SparseVector will be installed depends
on your system configuration.

If you do not have authority to write into system directories, you can
install Math::SparseVector in a local directory that you own and have 
permissions to read and write into as follows:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/YOUR/DIR
    make
    make test
    make install

This will install the module into

    /YOUR/DIR/lib/perl5/site_perl/Math/SparseMatrix.pm

If you install Math::SparseVector in a local directory, you will have to 
explicitly set your PERL5LIB environment variable to include:

    /YOUR/DIR/lib/perl5/site_perl

if this directory was not already included.
